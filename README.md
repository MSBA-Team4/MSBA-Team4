## Visualizations

## Project Scope

This project focuses specifically on AI in creative industries, with a narrow focus on AI-powered recommender systems in music streaming platforms. We aim to explore how user behaviors impact the effectiveness of recommendations, and how this behavior can be modeled to enhance user experience and engagement with the platform.

## Project Details

### Overview

Art is extremely subjective. Whether you are looking at a painting, reading a book, listening to a song, or watching a movie, you may have a completely different response to it than the person sitting next to you, experiencing the same piece of work, but in an entirely different way. This subjectivity is what makes it very difficult for AI to recreate art that has the same effect as that of created by human beings. 
While AI may not be the best way to create art, it can be useful in many different ways to supplement art made by humans. Within creative industries, AI is  transforming how artists, designers, writers, and musicians work, as it has the ability to edit photos and videos, proofread writing, and even generate its own images. 

### Our Topic: AI In Music Streaming Platforms 

Another example of AI being used to supplement creativity is through recommender systems. Because all forms of art are experienced in a very personal way, it can be useful to have the art you experience, whether it be books, movies, music, or something else entirely, be personalized to your tastes. AI can enhance discovery by understanding user behavior patterns. Many streaming services, such as Netflix or Spotify, are already using AI in order to make movie or music recommendations for their users. This is why, for the purposes of our project, we have chosen to explore how recommender systems, specifically in music streaming platforms, use AI to personalize listening experiences and make recommendations. 


### Problem

Describe our Problem

#### Business Importance:

Recommender systems are important for businesses in order to cater to their specific customer base overall, as well as allowing them to target multiple niche customer segments simultaneously. Personalized recommendations will improve user experience, which is always good for businesses. A user who feels the platform "gets" them is more likely to return, listen longer, and subscribe. Accurate recommendations increase  interaction with the platform and overall brand loyalty. The accuracy or quality of recommendations and personalization can even be used as a way for brands to differentiate among competitors.
Recommender systems are also very useful for platforms that rely on ad revenue, as targeted ads are more likely to lead to interactions or purchases.
Using AI for recommendations can also increase operational efficiency. The model has the ability to collect user data and make recommendations for a large scale of users in a short time.

## What's Next?
Looking ahead, future directions include:
- **Emotion-based or mood-aware recommendations**.
- **Real-time adaptation** to changing user behavior.
- Addressing **bias and fairness** in recommendation outputs.
- Exploring **multi-modal AI** (e.g., combining audio features, text metadata, and behavior).
- Considering **ethical implications** like filter bubbles and artist representation.

OR 

As music recommender systems become more advanced, future directions include:
- Incorporating mood/emotion detection from songs and user behavior.
- Real-time learning to adapt to shifting user tastes.
- Ethical concerns, such as reinforcing filter bubbles or limiting exposure to diverse music.
- Fairness and bias in music recommendations (e.g., under-promoting certain artists or genres).
- Broader application of multi-modal AI, combining text, audio, and user behavior to create richer models.
