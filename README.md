## Visualizations

## Project Scope

This project focuses specifically on AI in creative industries, with a narrow focus on AI-powered recommender systems in music streaming platforms. We aim to explore how user behaviors impact the effectiveness of recommendations, and how this behavior can be modeled to enhance user experience and engagement with the platform.

## Project Details

### Overview

### Our Topic

### Problem

Describe our Problem

#### Business Importance:

Recommender systems are critical for businesses to engage users, increase listening time, and boost retention. Personalized recommendations improve user satisfaction, driving platform loyalty and increasing the likelihood of premium subscriptions or ad interactions. Inaccurate recommendations can lead users to switch platforms or disengage entirely, affecting revenue and user growth.

### Research

## What's Next?
Looking ahead, future directions include:
- **Emotion-based or mood-aware recommendations**.
- **Real-time adaptation** to changing user behavior.
- Addressing **bias and fairness** in recommendation outputs.
- Exploring **multi-modal AI** (e.g., combining audio features, text metadata, and behavior).
- Considering **ethical implications** like filter bubbles and artist representation.

OR 

As music recommender systems become more advanced, future directions include:
- Incorporating mood/emotion detection from songs and user behavior.
- Real-time learning to adapt to shifting user tastes.
- Ethical concerns, such as reinforcing filter bubbles or limiting exposure to diverse music.
- Fairness and bias in music recommendations (e.g., under-promoting certain artists or genres).
- Broader application of multi-modal AI, combining text, audio, and user behavior to create richer models.
